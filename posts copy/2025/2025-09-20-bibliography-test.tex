\section{Bibliography and Citation Testing}

Today I'm testing the improved HTML compilation with bibliography support. This entry demonstrates how citations work in both PDF and HTML formats.

\subsection{Research Methods}

According to \cite{research_methods2024}, proper research methodology is crucial for academic work. The authors emphasize the importance of systematic approaches to data collection and analysis.

\subsection{Recent Findings}

Recent work by \cite{example2025} shows promising results in this area. Their methodology could be adapted for our current research project.

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}

The key equation for our analysis is:
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(t) e^{-2\pi i x t} dt
\end{equation}

This Fourier transform approach, as discussed in the literature, provides a robust framework for signal analysis.

\subsection{Future Work}

Based on the reviewed literature, our next steps should include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implementing the methodology from \cite{research_methods2024}
\item Extending the results of \cite{example2025}
\item Developing new mathematical frameworks
\end{enumerate}
