        <h1>Thinking Machines</h1>
        
        <p class="intro">We're building a future where everyone has access to the knowledge and tools to make AI work for their unique needs and goals.</p>
        
        <h2>Science is better when shared</h2>
        
        <p><em>Scientific progress is a collective effort.</em> We believe that we'll most effectively advance humanity's understanding of AI by collaborating with the wider community of researchers and builders. We plan to frequently publish technical blog posts, papers, and code.</p>
        
        <h2>AI that works for everyone</h2>
        
        <p><em>Emphasis on human-AI collaboration.</em> Instead of focusing solely on making fully autonomous AI systems, we are excited to build multimodal systems that work with people collaboratively.</p>
        
        <p><em>More flexible, adaptable, and personalized AI systems.</em> We see enormous potential for AI to help in every field of work. While current systems excel at programming and mathematics, we're building AI that can adapt to the full spectrum of human expertise.</p>
        
        <h2>Join us</h2>
        
        <p>We're building AI systems that push technical boundaries while delivering real value to as many people as possible. Our team combines rigorous engineering with creative exploration, and we're looking for collaborators to help shape this vision.</p>
